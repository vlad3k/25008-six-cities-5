    text: `Leo is a great host and replied quickly to my messages. The location is great! It’s by a train stop and it’s close to places for sightseeing and restaurants. I arrived at night and thought the area was a little too dark (nothing happened to me), so be mindful of that if you are not getting dropped off at the door and are arriving at night. The loft lacks a little privacy and the bed is not very comfortable. I loved the self check in system and the location the best.`,
